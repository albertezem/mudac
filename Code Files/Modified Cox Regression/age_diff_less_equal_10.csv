They completed their match meeting right before winter break. During St. Thomas J-term they did not meet. Most matches do not meet over J-term. When the spring semester started B_first_name Arykah did not resume her meetings with L_first_name. PC called, emailed, and texted B_first_name Arykah to check-in. See match activity log for attempts. Unfortunitely, at this time I do not think it is safe for the match to continue due to a lack of consistency and communication. I had a closure conversation with L_first_name in-person at Four Seasons on 3/28. L_first_name said she liked coloring with B_first_name Arykah. She described B_first_name Arykah as nice and said she made her smile. L_first_name put her head down as we spoke and used a quiet voice when we spoke. PC interpret this as her being sad the match did not work out. PC said it is okay to feel sad or disappointed that the match did not work out. I got the impression L_first_name had a great first meeting with B_first_name Arykah and wanted to keep being her Little Sister moving forward. PC emphasized that this is in no way L_first_name?s fault and she is not the reason the match is closing. PC said that we do not know everything that is going on with B_first_name Arykah. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: L_first_name said she felt safe with her mentor. They technically only met one time. Mentor stopped showing up and communicating with BBBS. ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬ 3) Rematch Child (Y/N): Yes. 4) Reason: Expressed interest in being matched again. ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬ 5) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: Mentor stopped showing up and communication with BBBS. PC would suggest not accepting B_first_name Arykah to be a mentor again for a bit. Her communication and follow through skills need improvement. Maybe in 3-4 years she will improve in this and then BBBS can reassess her for being a mentor.

BS and LB were close and had a good match. LB and BS completed homework and actively engaged in the match activities. One place of growth for the match was around sharing power. LB always seemed to express an interest in playing basketball and seem disengaged when BS offered up other activities for match to try. After speaking to BS and LB about sharing power, match seemed to do better. Both LB and BS reported feeling that their choices were heard when they were with each other. BS began to miss meetings due to being on Varsity Badminton but wrote letters to stay in touch with LB. BS and LB had a good time in program and both grew in their time together. Match is unable to continue because LB and BS will both be transitioning to different schools in the fall. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: There are no child safety concerns in the context of this match. 3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No ? Reason: LB is transitioning to middle school where programming is not offered. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No ? Reason: BS is transitioning to college in the Fall of 2019. ? Should volunteer be red-flagged in AIM as a child safety concern (Y/N): No",2018-03-16 00:00:00,,Both BS and LB have similar interests. MC believes BS will grow herself by learning about LB.

B_first_name said his favorite activity with L_first_name was playing Connect Four. They liked playing games together. L_first_name was shy in the beginning of the match. BB enjoyed watch him becaome more confient in himself and his language skills as they met. B_first_name suggested matches spend more time together to improve the BBBS program. He suggested having BBBS more than once a week. PC made three attempts to set up a closure meeting on 5/11, 5/12, & 5/17 with PG but unfortunitly did not make contact. PC also called L_first_name?s school and made sure he updated contact information. PC tried to set up a closure meeting with LB teacher at school. A closure meeting was attempted but incomplete because unofrtunitly the day of the closure meeting LB had a substitute teacher and the meeting was virtual and LB did not login.

They met for one school year at Four Seasons until COVID struck. Over the pandemic BS and LS met virtually and continued their friendship. B_first_name?s favorite activity in BBBS was drawing and a music making online activity. L_first_name?s favorite activity was painting and the music making activity too. BS enjoyed watching LS open up and talk more over their match. She liked getting to know L_first_name more and see her grow in future thinking and thinking about her interets. L_first_name said she appreciated that B_first_name gave her ?honest opinions.? She added that B_first_name ?opened meethings with a Big smile? and they talked a lot. L_first_name added that activities were fun and their time together was respectful. BS and LS match is closing because L_first_name graduated from Four Seasons Elementary School and will not be at a site-based school next year. PC talked with B_first_name about the options for the match (continue virtually, community based, close the match). B_first_name chose closing the match because it would add flexibility to their relationship. BS and LS plan to stay in-touch informally and continue their friendship in this way. They already have each others contact information as a virtual match. BS is also graduating this December. B_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program. She said the virtual activity suggestions were very helpful and when they were meeting in-person she liked the balance of choice time and planned activitys. L_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the program. At the match closure meeting it was clear that BBBS was a positive experience for BS & LS and they grew in the program. L_first_name and B_first_name mutually appreciated each other. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. B_first_name said she did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name and L_first_name said she always felt safe with B_first_name. ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬ 3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name no longer attends a site-based school. PC spoke to PG about how to enroll LS in the community based program and passed along the website to enroll a child. PG said she plans to talk to LS about this and see what she thinks. If L_first_name applies to the community based program PC highly suggests she is accepted. PC can see LS forming another special connection with a caring adult. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name is graduating from college this December. L_first_name said BBBS should accept B_first_name in the future as a volunteer because she respects people, tells the truth, is very welcoming, and has a calm energy. PC would agree and a highly suggest B_first_name be accepted in the future if she applies again. She went above and beyond as a virtual mentor and did a great job of forming a caring friendship with a child. ?

B_first_name and L_first_name?s were matched in November of 2019. They met for 26 months which included time at Four Seasons and being pen pals over the pandemic. B_first_names favorite activity with L_first_name was making braclets and coloring. L_first_name?s favorite activity was also braclet making. B_first_name enjoyed watching L_first_name become more expressive over their match. She noted that LS beat BS in every game they played. L_first_name said she appreciated B_first_name?s kind words. She added that if she said a bad word her Big Sister would tell her not to say that and she appreciated that. PC had a closure conversation with BS in-person on 12/14/21. PC also held a closure meeting for BS and LS on 12/14/21. During the closure meeting L_first_name was silent. B_first_name was able to share with L_first_name how she enjoyed their time together and she said goodbye. PC had a closure conversation with L_first_name in-person at Four Seasons A+ Elementary School on 1/4/21. B_first_name said the BBBS program was pretty good and she did not have any suggestions for improving the program. L_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the program as well. B_first_name gave PC permission to share her phone number with PG to informally stay in touch with LS. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: B_first_name said she did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name and L_first_name said she she always felt safe with B_first_name. My experience was that L_first_name had a challenging time following adult direction. She even left the BBBS classrooms a few times without asking. She would wonder the halls and then come back. L_first_name also had some unqique behavior concerns. She poked herself with a pin during a BBBS meeting and did need to return to class a few BBBS meetings because she did not follow the BBBS rules. I do not have any other safety concerns. ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬ 3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name is a fifth grader and will be graduating from Four Seasons A+ this spring. I would also not recommend her for a community based match because her PG was challenging to communicate with over the pandemic. The safety concern above also encourages make PC think that a community based match would not be a good fit right now. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ?

They met at Four Seasons Elementary School until COVID started. At the start of COVID BS wrote letters to LS to stay in touch. PC was able to facilitate a VMI for their B_first_name and L_first_name in November of 2020 and they started to meet virtually weekly. However, it sounds like communicating with PG was sometimes challenging and sometimes L_first_name did not login to meetings. In February of 2021 PG messaged PG to close the match. She said nothing was wrong with the match but she did not want to waste B_first_name?s time any longer. PC tried to dig deeper and see if they could transition the match to a program that would be successful for BS and LS. PG stated very clearly she wanted to close the match. PG made three attempts to contact PG and LS to schedule a closure meeting and have a closure conversation. See activity log for attempts. Unfortunitely, PC lost contact with PG. PC had a closure conversation with B_first_name via the phone on 3/8/21. Kaitelyn said her favorite activity in BBBS happened recently. L_first_name had been writing songs with her cousin. LS was sharing and performing these songs during virtual meetings. BS enjoyed watching LS grow in confidence as she shared these songs. Kaityln also noted that L_first_name had been growing in taking more responsibility over their match. BS said she did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program. It has been a ?whirlwind of a experience? with COVID but she thinks BBBS has done the best it can given the circumstances. B_first_name did note that virtual meetings were easier for her because they allowed more flexibility. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: No, Kaitelyn did not have any safety cocnerns. ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬ 3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ?
